<p align="left">Dear Authors of SpaCCS 2016 and its associated Symposiums/Workshops,</p>
<p>Thanks for publishing your SpaCCS 2016/ISSR 2016/TrustData 2016/TSP 2016/NOPE 2016/DependSys 2016/BigDataSPT 2016/WCSSC 2016 papers with Springer LNCS. Please make sure to submit your full package of files (with package name: conference/symposium/workshop acronym+paper ID+corresponding author name.zip) to Ms. Pin Liu (<a href="mailto:spaccs2016@gmail.com">spaccs2016@gmail.com</a>) by <font color="red">September 15, 2016 </font>with any time zone (<font color="red">FIRM DEADLINE</font>).</p>

<p>Here is the Checklist of your full package of files: </p>
<p>(1)The following is a URL link to the "Information for LNCS Authors" web page <font color="red">(Springer LNCS Author Kit)</font> for the 9th International Conference on Security, Privacy and Anonymity in Computation, Communication and Storage (SpaCCS 2016) and its seven symposiums/workshops:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0" target="_blank">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</a></p>
<p>We need the source files (LaTeX files with all the associated style files, special fonts and eps or bib files, or Word or rtf files) and the final PDF file of your camera-ready paper (final paper). There should be one set of source files and one PDF file per paper. Please strictly use the Latex Style files or WORD templates appeared in the above Springer LNCS Author Kit when preparing your camera-ready paper. Notice that your final PDF file should NOT contain any page numbers. Also notice that your final PDF file should NOT contain any running head. Also notice that the final PDF file MUST be exactly corresponding to the final source files.</p><br/>
<p>(2)We need a "Consent to Publish form", signed by one author on behalf of all of the authors of the paper. Please download a <a href="LNCS-Springer_Copyright_Form-SpaCCS2016.pdf" target="_blank">partially completed copyright form</a> for the SpaCCS 2016 conference and its associated symposiums/workshops. Notice that we do not accept digital signatures, so please make sure that your Consent to Publish form will have been signed in ink. Please scan those two pages of the form and convert them to a PDF file. The file name can be "Consent to Publish form.pdf".</p><br/>

<p>(3)The name and e-mail address of the contact author who will check the proof of the paper. Approximately one to two weeks after the Volume Editors send all of the files to Springer, the authors are given the opportunity to check the final PDF files of their papers. The contact author should be available to check the proof of the paper upon request in a timely way.</p><br/>

<p>(4)A suggestion for an abbreviated running head, if appropriate. Please do not put any page numbers and/or running head in the paper. However, please suggest that you provide an abbreviated running head for your paper if the title of your paper is too long. The typesetting team at Springer will insert running heads, final page numbers, and a reference line at the bottom of the first page of each paper on all papers accordingly.</p><br/>

<p>(5)Information about correct representation of authors' names, where necessary. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>TIP 1: In the first page of your final paper, please indicate authors' names in the following way: First Name (Given Name) followed by Last Name (Family Name).</p>
  <p>TIP 2: If your name contains complex family names, particles, or suffixes, please let us know what is your given name and what is your family name; otherwise, you don't need to let us know explicitly what is your given name and what is your family because we can easily identify them in the first page of your final paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(6)Please put the information about Item (3), Item (4), and Item (5) together in a text file within the full package of files. Please use "additional information.txt" as the filename to include such information.</p><br/>

<p>(7)About the title of your paper: Please use upper case letter for the first letter of each word in the title; for prepositions and conjunctions such as "for" and "and", do not apply this rule, use lower case letter for the first letter of such words instead.</p><br/>

<p>(8) About the keywords of your paper: Please provide 5-8 keywords for your paper. Please use semicolon (";") to separate between two keywords. Please follow the formatting rule to use "upper case first letter" for each word as in the title, except for propositions and conjunctions and the like. Notice that the "Keywords" section should be formatted the same as the "Abstract" section; the "Keywords" section should NOT be formatted the same as the "Introduction" section.</p><br/>

<p>(9)About Affiliations: Please use either of the following sample formats (ZIP code right after the city name or after the country name):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sample 1: School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China </p>
  <p>or</p>
  <p>Sample 2: School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China, 410083 </p>
</blockquote>
<br/>

<p>(13) Do not send the package of files together with registration files. We have different people to deal with camera-ready submission and registration respectively.</p><br/>

-------------------------------------------<br>
P.S. Two LaTex commands for your reference:<br/>
-------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
1) To remove all page numbers and running heads in LaTex, please use the command \pagestyle{empty} before the document begins. <br><br>
For example:<br/><br/>
\documentclass[runningheads,a4paper]{llncs}<br>
......<br>
\pagestyle{empty}<br><br><br>
\begin{document}<br>
......<br>
\end{document}
</p>

<p>
2) To mark the corresponding author in the first page of the paper, you should use a small envelope. You can use the bbding package of LaTex, and use the command \inst{<no> (}\Envelope\inst{)} right after the name of the corresponding author, where <no> is the number referring to different addresses or affiliations.  <br><br>
For example, Guojun Wang is the corresponding author and he is with the first affiliation, then it should be coded as follows:<br/><br/>
\documentclass[runningheads,a4paper]{llncs}<br>
......<br><br>
\usepackage{bbding}<br><br><br>
\pagestyle{empty}<br><br><br>
\begin{document}<br><br>
......<br><br>
\author{ Guojun Wang \inst{1 (}\Envelope\inst{)} }<br>
......<br>
\end{document}<br><br>
